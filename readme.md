A simple space shooter game, kind of asteroids clone, but gonna  add some aliens...<br>
I wrote this to try out my skills in go. Uses a simple graphics lib (**raylib**) some go concurrency

_Controls:_
- [**A**] - Turn left
- [**S**], [**W**] - small thrust, more thrust
- [**D**] - Turn right
- [**Ctrl**] - Shoot a missile
- [**M**] - Mute/Unmute sounds

Runs in a 1440 x 720 window. Keeps around 60 fps on Ryzen 7 (8core) with RX 480 gpu.
